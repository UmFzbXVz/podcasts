			<title>#001 Interview With A Man Who Sold LSD To Steve Jobs</title>
			<description>I don't usually interview people involved with the distribution side of psychedelics, but this conversation touches on so many fascinating topics in the history of LSD that I thought other people might find it interesting. The conversation covers Steve Jobs, Kary Mullis, ergotamine tartrate, LSD distribution, and SARS-CoV-2. </description>

			<title>#003 Interview With An MK-801-Naut</title>
			<description>A most superlative discussion of NMDA antagonists! MK-801 is the strongest dissociative that has been used by humans, it is also one of the most mysterious and (arguably) one of the most dangerous. Episode three of my podcast features an interview with a teenager who ordered MK-801 and tested it on himself and his friends. </description>

			<title>#005 Journal Club: LSD and the Head Twitch Response</title>
			<description>This podcast is the first of what I hope to be a series of "journal club" discussions with scientists about an important scientific paper. In this episode Jason Wallach and I discuss the strange origin of the head twitch response and how it became the most important behavioral correlate for 5HT2A agonism in non-human animals. </description>

			<title>#009 A Talk With Eric Andre</title>
			<description>Hi, all. It turns out Eric Andre is a fan of the show and he called me yesterday to talk, here is our conversation.

In other news, we are gearing up to print a third and final edition of the pamphlet. The first edition was only 500 copies and contained a couple typos, the second edition is 2,500 copies and the third edition will be 5,000 copies. The pamphlet has already raised more than $70,000 for the Michael J Fox Foundation and more than $10,000 for the original toad artist Gail Patterson. As stipulated in the episode, I also plan to donate some money to toad conservation efforts via the Tucson Herpetological Society, but I'm waiting on them to propose a specific plan for the money before making the donation. Thanks everyone who bought a copy and for those that didn't I will be sure to post here first when the new edition is available.

I've recorded a couple of new Patreon-exclusive interviews that I'm currently editing, one about the chemistry of N-hydroxy-MDA and another that is a long discussion of the meth episode and disparaging article about the show by Erik Davis.  

I hope to have those out by the end of the week.

			<title>Interview With A European PCE Chemist</title>
			<description>Hi, all. I've been receiving interesting messages from a variety of different chemists recently. Here is a discussion with a chemist who synthesized and tested an unusual arylcyclohexylamine called PCE

EDIT: I was interested in learning more about his technique for producing NaCN. I've attached an interesting article from 1895 that describes a similar process as well as a long Science Madness thread. Cyanide's reputation is deserved, it is seriously a deadly poison, a chemist friend killed himself with it last year. This is not some corny, "Don't try this at home!" boilerplate. Seriously––do not try this at home. </description>
