Article Text: Persistently high inflation has brought back fears of a wage-price spiral. Our economics team Soumaya Keynes, Simon Rabinovitch and Callum Williams explore how expectations of high inflation become reality. We look at the data on whether workers or firms are winning the battle over wages. And, as they reach for all the tools at their disposal, are central banks still in control?

Article Text: In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the West imposed unprecedented financial sanctions, effectively freezing the reserve assets of Russia. This triggered chaos in Russia's economy and prompted president Vladimir Putin to make nuclear threats, sending shock waves around the world. Will Russia weaponise energy and cut off its oil and gas supplies to the West? And, having crossed the Rubicon, the West has a new potent weapon—its use is being watched very carefully by China.

Article Text: As America and Britain announced embargoes on Russian energy, our global energy and climate innovation editor Vijay Vaitheeswaran talked to oil and gas industry leaders in Houston where jaws dropped and prices soared. He asks Jose Fernandez, US undersecretary of state for economic growth, and Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, whether the West can afford to ban Russian oil. As governments scramble to plug the shortfall, we talk to Scott Sheffield, head of Pioneer Natural Resources, and Vicki Hollub, chief executive of Occidental Petroleum, about whether this could be American shale’s big moment. And Bob Dudley, former boss of BP who now heads the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, argues the rush for energy security doesn't necessarily put the energy transition on hold.

Headline: Money Talks: The economics of thinness
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: Across the rich world there is a negative relationship between incomes and weight, as measured by body mass index. The richer people are, the thinner they tend to be. But separate the data by gender and a startling gap appears. Rich women are much thinner than poorer ones; but rich men and poor men are just as likely to be overweight or obese.

Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: For decades, the North Sea’s fierce gales have created a challenge for those extracting the oil and gas buried beneath its swells. But the region’s poor weather is also the key to its future: offshore wind. And the plans are surprisingly ambitious.

Headline: Money Talks: How globalisation gave way
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: America has changed the way it views the rest of the world. Rather than pushing for a more globalised economy with fewer trade barriers, the US is now seeking a more protected system of international trade. President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act promises nearly $400bn to boost clean energy and reduce dependence on China for things like batteries for electric cars. The Chips Act, meanwhile, provides incentives worth $52bn to boost America’s semiconductor industry.

Headline: Money Talks: Can Disney rekindle the magic?
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: The Walt Disney Company turns 100 years old this week. But the silver screen success that helped it become the world’s biggest entertainment company will not be enough to keep it on top for another century. As households swap cable packages for streaming, and kids turn to gaming, rather than movies, Disney needs reanimating.

Headline: Money Talks: Goldman Sags
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: Goldman once dominated Wall Street. In 2009, after the financial crisis, when most financial institutions were left reeling, Goldman had its best year ever. It appeared an apex-predator, one that could outsmart its rivals in even the toughest environments. But the last decade has been humbling for Goldman.

Headline: Money Talks: The king of quants
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: Quantitative investors are known for their cool, mathematical approach to investing. They build models which search for patterns across huge data sets to discern where they should invest. The frenzied “bubble in everything” wrongfooted many quants in 2020–but the stock markets return to Earth, which crippled many traditional funds, generated huge returns for the quants in 2022. Nowhere was this clearer than in the performance of AQR Capital Management, a quant fund run by Cliff Asness. Its long-running strategy returned 43.5% last year, net of fees.

Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: The rise of Korea’s musicians from local celebrities to international superstars is credited to Lee Soo-man, the godfather of K-pop. The industry he developed gave rise to groups like BTS, which has been the biggest-selling band in the world for two years running. Now, Lee has sold most of his stake in SM Entertainment, the company he founded, to one of its biggest rivals.

Headline: Money Talks: Not made in China
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: China was the source of $1trn-worth of electronic goods and components in 2021, roughly a third of the global total. And it’s not just consumer electronics that begin their life in China. The country is the source of everything from childrens’ toys to medical equipment—it dominates the global supply chain. But manufacturers are increasingly looking elsewhere to make their products as China’s rising wages and growing tensions with the US make its factories less attractive than its neighbours.

Headline: Money Talks: The rise of the robots
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: Robots are getting better and cheaper—and that means they will play a much larger role in our lives. They are already reaching beyond the car plants and warehouses, where they have become commonplace, to turn their mechanised hands to making cocktails and cooking chicken. But what will that mean for the economy?

Headline: Money Talks: Discredit Suisse
Provider: Money Talks
Article Text: Few would have predicted that the demise of Silicon Valley Bank, a niche Californian lender, would be followed by the failure of Credit Suisse. But on March 19 the banking crisis reached Zurich, where regulators brokered a fire sale that saw the ailing 167-year-old bank sold to rival UBS.
