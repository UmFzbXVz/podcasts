			<description>In June, the US Supreme Court overruled Roe v Wade and ended the constitutional right to abortion in America. In a special episode, we investigate the changing dynamic of abortion rights globally in countries like Colombia, China and Ireland. We'll also be examining the restrictions still faced by women in Africa and places like Malta and El Salvador.

Audio for this episode was updated on 4 July 2022, due to a factual error in an earlier version.</description>

			<description>The Biden administration had been strongly criticised for not sanctioning the Crown Prince directly, despite blaming him for the journalist's murder in an official report last week. The US State Department insists it is focused on Saudi Arabia’s future conduct. Also: a BBC reporter covering the deadly conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray province is detained by the military, and the Nobel prize winning author Kazuo Ishiguro discusses the inspiration behind his new novel.</description>

			<description>A US intelligence report has found that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman approved the murder of exiled journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.

Also, Myanmar's ambassador to the UN has condemned the military coup in his country and has sided strongly with mass protests, and we hear why fish in Kenya are dying in large numbers.</description>

			<description>Both Donald Trump are Joe Biden are optimisitic of victory after a nailbiting night which saw the president projected to hold the key states of Florida and Ohio. Mr Biden has told supporters that he is still on track to win but Mr Trump has accused him of trying to &quot;steal&quot; the election. We take you through the night as it came down to a handful of states in the American Midwest. They will now decide the outcome that could take hours, or even days, to be decided with so many postal votes yet to be counted.</description>

Also: Federal prosecutors in the United States have charged Donald Trump over his handling of classified documents after he left the White House, and new research suggests that there are far more people in India with diabetes than previously thought.</description>
